# Introduction

## What is USTN?

USTN is Treasurenet's stablecoin, the token with the smallest volatility, originally anchored at 1 US dollar. It aims to provide users with a stable and efficient digital currency. You can obtain a stable digital asset by purchasing or exchanging USTN, which can be used for cryptocurrency trading or other online payments in the future.

## What is USTN Finance?

USTN Finance is a visualization system built by Treasurenet around USTN for deposit, withdrawal, and loan repayments. This system aims to provide everyone with a convenient and easy-to-use digital asset management method, allowing everyone to manage their digital assets more efficiently.

In USTN Finance, you can obtain USTN by exchanging UNIT, or retrieve UNIT by returning USTN. You can also deposit USTN in Finance and earn corresponding interest. In addition, you can lend USTN from Finance by pledging UNIT to meet capital requirements. Of course, loan operations need to return a certain interest according to regulations to ensure the liquidity of the system's funds. Furthermore, you can participate in auctions and bid for collaterals from some liquidated loans. In this process, you can acquire collaterals by bidding, thus realizing value appreciation.

In summary, USTN Finance provides a multifunctional digital asset management tool that can help users conveniently manage digital assets and improve the value and liquidity of digital assets.
