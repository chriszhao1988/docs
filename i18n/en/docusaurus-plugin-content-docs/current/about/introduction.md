# Introduction

Treasurenet is a blockchain protocol that aims to construct an online digital economic system by mapping the real-world mining activities of mineral resources, thereby creating an ecosystem where the real economy and the digital economy can develop together.

At its inception, Treasurenet will regard petroleum and natural gas as the two types of mineral resources that can generate value on Treasurenet. With the continuous increase in the total value of offline mining resources, the block rewards of Treasurenet will also keep increasing. This not only promotes the continuous development of Treasurenet's online economic system, but also provides motivation for offline mining. As a result, the online and offline economies related to Treasurenet will constantly influence each other positively and drive each other, forming a complete and stable economic ecological cycle.
