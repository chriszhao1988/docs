# Producer

## What is Producer

Producers are economic contributors in Treasurenet, providing physical or digital assets to Treasurenet. A Producer can be a bulk commodity company that produces physical products, and it can also be a "miner" of cryptocurrency in Treasurenet, producing digital assets and providing power for our decentralized system.

## Benefits of becoming a Producer

- Upload asset data to Treasurenet and obtain corresponding TAT Tokens based on its real value
- Asset value is not affected by fiat currency inflation
- Not only own the profits of assets in real life, but also obtain digital currency in Treasurenet

## Production Data

Production Data refers to the output of physical or digital assets provided by the Producer. It first requires the Producer to provide the real output of assets, obtain the unit price of assets from public price websites, and then conduct decentralized output auditing. After passing the audit, TAT will be minted corresponding to the asset value. Currently, the initial assets in Treasurenet are oil and natural gas. In the future, we will add more real, clearly measurable, and clearly priced assets such as nickel and copper to contribute to the online economic system.

### Oil & Gas

Because the current production process of oil and natural gas is most systematic, and the measurement process and unit price are relatively clear, we chose oil and natural gas as the physical assets at the beginning of the establishment of Treasurenet. At present, we choose to use oil and natural gas in the Canadian region, which has relatively strict and transparent government supervision, and the asset data is sufficiently real and transparent.

## What qualifications are needed to become a Producer

We have delegated the establishment of producer qualifications to the Maintainer of that resource. Obviously, different resources will require radically different qualifications.
