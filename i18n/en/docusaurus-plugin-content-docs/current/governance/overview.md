# Introduction

TreasureNet has an on-chain governance mechanism for initiating text proposals, changing chain parameters, modifying built-in contract parameters, and spending funds from the community pool.

### Decision-making and Communication Discussion Channels

Communication channels involve community members at different levels, and individuals often play multiple different roles in the ecosystem (such as validator, user, developer, or core member of the TN team, etc.). Communication and direction setting in terms of technology are almost always open, and changes in members are completely traceable.
