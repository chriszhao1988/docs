# Transfer Tokens

Once you are linked to the Treasurenet Blockchain Network, you can start using your wallet to transfer Tokens peer-to-peer without the involvement of a bank or other intermediaries. This gives you full ownership of your assets and complete autonomy over your passwords.

## View Balances

You can view the balance of all encrypted assets on Treasurenet, including native UNIT, USTN and TAT, and assets created on the Treasurenet Blockchain Network.

The balance of an asset is described by the number of tokens and their USD equivalents.
As with any other currency, crypto assets can be used as a store of value or a medium of exchange.

Only when an asset is traded on an exchange can its price be determined by the supply and demand relative to other assets.
UNIT Token provides additional utility on Treasurenet as it is used to protect the network by staking, voting on governance proposals and paying gas.

Assets on TreasureNet can be represented as various token types (e.g. Cosmos IBC tokens or EVM ERC20 tokens). However, unless you are a developer, you only need to know the asset name and the Treasurenet network will automatically perform the conversion between them.

## Onramp to TreasureNet

To start using Treasurenet, a small amount of UNIT tokens is required to cover gas fees when transferring tokens or interacting with dApps. This prevents users from sending unnecessary data to the network for free and disrupting its operation, while also rewarding those who maintain the network.

Options for obtaining initial UNIT Tokens include:

- Use a decentralized exchange like Uniswap (coming soon).
- Ask a friend to transfer you UNIT.
- If you try testnet, you can use faucet to get a small amount of tokens.
